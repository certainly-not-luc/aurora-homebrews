            <p>
                Deities of the Poverty Domain value quality of devotion over quantity and have strict requirements for their Clerics. They are required to give up all material possessions beyond basic necessities. Usually, Clerics of Poverty are only armed with a quarterstaff and carry only a small amount of food and water and a cloak on their back. These fervently devout Clerics are bound by divine law to seek peace above all, resorting to violence only when all other options have been exhausted.
